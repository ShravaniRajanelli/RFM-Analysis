# RFM-Analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary Value) in Marketing

 Recency, frequency, monetary value (RFM) is a model used in marketing analysis that segments a company’s consumer base by their purchasing patterns or habits. In particular, it evaluates customers’ recency (how long ago they made a purchase), frequency (how often they make purchases), and monetary value (how much money they spend).
 RFM is then used to identify a company’s or an organization’s best customers by measuring and analyzing spending habits to improve low-scoring customers and maintain high-scoring ones.
 An RFM analysis evaluates clients and customers by scoring them in three categories: how recently they’ve made a purchase, how often they buy, and the size of their purchases.
The RFM model assigns a score of 1 to 5 (from worst to best) for customers in each of the three categories.
RFM analysis helps firms reasonably predict which customers are likely to purchase their products again, how much revenue comes from new (vs. repeat) clients, and how to turn occasional buyers into habitual ones.

 ## Understanding Recency, Frequency, Monetary Value
The RFM model is based on three quantitative factors:
1) Recency: How recently a customer has made a purchase
2) Frequency: How often a customer makes a purchase
3) Monetary value: How much money a customer spends on purchases
RFM analysis numerically ranks a customer in each of these three categories, generally on a scale of 1 to 5 (the higher the number, the better the result). The “best” customer would receive a top score in every category.

### Recency
The more recently a customer has made a purchase with a company, the more likely they will continue to keep the business and brand in mind for subsequent purchases. Compared with customers who have not bought from the business in months or even longer periods, the likelihood of engaging in future transactions with recent customers is arguably higher.
Such information can be used to get recent customers to revisit the business and spend more. In an effort not to overlook lapsed customers, marketing efforts might be made to remind them that it’s been a while since their last transaction, while offering them an incentive to resume buying.

### Frequency
The frequency of a customer’s transactions may be affected by factors such as the type of product, the price point for the purchase, and the need for replenishment or replacement. If the purchase cycle can be predicted—for example, when a customer needs to buy more groceries—marketing efforts may be directed toward reminding them to visit the business when staple items run low.

### Monetary Value
Monetary value stems from how much the customer spends. A natural inclination is to put more emphasis on encouraging customers who spend the most money to continue to do so. While this can produce a better return on investment (ROI) in marketing and customer service, it also runs the risk of alienating customers who have been consistent but may not spend as much with each transaction.

## Significance of Recency, Frequency, Monetary Value
RFM analysis allows a comparison between potential contributors and clients. It gives organizations a sense of how much revenue comes from repeat customers (vs. new customers), and which levers they can pull to try to make customers happier so they become repeat purchasers.

## Purpose
This repository provides code and tools for conducting RFM Analysis on customer data. The goal is to help businesses gain insights into their customer base and make data-driven decisions to improve marketing and sales efforts.
